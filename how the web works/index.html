        <h2>How Does a Website Work?</h2>
        <p>A website works by using a web server to host its digital content and then sending that content to a user's web browser when they request it. The web server uses HTTP, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol, to communicate with the user's browser and deliver the content in a format that can be displayed on the user's device.</p>
